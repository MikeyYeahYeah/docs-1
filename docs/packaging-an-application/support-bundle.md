A support bundle archive will be available for your customer to download via the Support tab of the On-Prem Console.

You can customize the content on the page by including markdown in the top-level of your YAML.

Support bundle collection of any specific item, command or file will timeout after 30 seconds. The entire package will download all successful files, commands etc collected before the 30 second mark.

```yaml
replicated_api_version: "{{< replicated_api_version_current >}}"
name: ELK
console_support_markdown: |
  # Email Us for help:
  #### support@getelk.com
  Or don't, your loss.
